**Professional. Proven. Free.**

Overview
--------

GGA Software Services LLC, now LifeSciences unit of EPAM Systems, Inc.,  has received an exclusive license from
Pfizer Inc. to create and distribute an open-source version of Pfizer's
internal chemistry electronic lab notebook, known as CeN, and Indigo ELN
is the resulting open-source version that is available for your use,
integration, and customization.

Benefiting from the considerable investment by Pfizer in its internal
chemistry ELN, Indigo ELN provides scientists with a proven way to
create, store, retrieve, and share electronic records of chemistry
information in ways that meet all legal, regulatory, technical, and
scientific requirements.

Indigo ELN allows scientists to prepare, plan, and analyze experiments,
access relevant information, and develop new methods in the areas of
synthetic chemistry, analytical chemistry, and process chemistry.

Through the use of Indigo ELN, you can upgrade your existing ELN with
a proven and tested open-source platform, and you can do it at no
charge.

Indigo ELN combines the best of both worlds: an application developed
and refined at Pfizer and tested by thousands of chemists there, and an
open-source application that is available at no cost.

----------

**Why Select Indigo ELN as Your Chemistry ELN?**


Cost benefits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The core Indigo ELN product is free of charge, as it is distributed
   under an open-source license, GNU General Public License, Version 3.
-  Total integration costs are much less than the licensing costs of
   commercial products.
-  Indigo ELN represents a leading cost-effective alternative to
   commercial ELN products.

Modern technologies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Indigo ELN is an established Java-based solution with multi-tier
   architecture. It is based on Pfizer's internal chemistry ELN.

Proven solution developed and used by Pfizer for years
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Indigo ELN is based on Pfizer's internal chemistry ELN, which has
   been developed and improved by Pfizer over many years. In this way,
   Indigo ELN benefits from the input from thousands of Pfizer users
   regarding user interface, workflows, and core functionalities.
-  Changes in the core application were driven by feedback from chemists
   in Pfizer's Global Research and Development organization.

Integration with external systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The core Indigo ELN product is shipped with the basic services
   included.
-  EPAM is available to implement any requested services and to integrate
   the solution with your infrastructure.
-  Indigo ELN will integrate seamlessly with Pfizer's services. All of
   the data in Indigo ELN will be recognized by Pfizer's services and
   databases.

Core Indigo ELN Package
-----------------------

The package provides the main functionality of Pfizer's internal
chemistry ELN without using any proprietary Pfizer services or
commercial third-party products, which were removed as part of putting
the ELN into the open-source community.

The core Indigo ELN package includes:

-  Database tier – Oracle, Oracle Express edition or PostgreSQL database
   (In addition, Indigo ELN supports EPAM's open-source molecular search
   cartridge Bingo\ :sup:`©` for these databases).
-  Core user interface for creation of singleton experiments and
   conception records.
-  Major services:

   -  Basic functionality and user interfaces for creating, describing,
      and managing singleton experiments and concept records.
   -  Signature service to sign and witness experiments.
   -  Reaction rendering and chemical properties calculation based on
      EPAM's open-source cheminformatics engine Indigo\ :sup:`©`.
   -  Compound registration and structure search services

-  Support both Ketcher (EPAM's open-source editor) and ISIS Draw for
   structure editing
-  APIs to integrate with existing customer services and databases.

EPAM is available to support customers in integrating Indigo ELN with
their services and databases, as well as in creating new services.

EPAM's Open-Source Products to Complement Indigo ELN
